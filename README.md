Here are some papers I've contributed to as part of research projects!

In the "Implementing PCA..." paper, I worked on implementing and accelerating a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm in C.
PCA is a statistical analysis technique used to project highly dimensional data on a smaller subspace while preserving most of the information.
By parallelizing basic matrix operations necessary for the algorithm, we were able to achieve a significant speedup.

In the "Pushing B-Cubed..." paper, I worked to establish the hardness of a modified version of the online block puzzle game "B-Cubed." 
While the game, as it exists online, can easily be proven to be NP-Complete, through a simple modification we end up with an incredibly
complex puzzle, which we establish as likely to be PSPACE-Complete.
